#### Topic background####
 This project is aimed to design and make a product that could run Windows system on
 your smartphone（SOC1：snapdragon 845） and help meet some light mobile office
 needs for people, meanwhile my artefact could also realize the local switch of
 Android system and Windows System, which means you could switch to Android
 system to order some food or drinks to have a break after your work or have a phone
 call at any time you want. And my product aimed to provide a lower cost other than
 the normal laptop in the market. Otherwise , we could also turns your old smartphone
 into a new personal computer for you.
